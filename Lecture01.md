## 🧩 1. Big-Endian and Little-Endian Organization

### 🧠 Concept Overview
Computers store data in memory as **bytes**.  
For multi-byte data (e.g., 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit integers), the **order** in which bytes are stored in memory differs between systems — known as **Endianness**.

---

### 🔹 Definitions

- **Big-Endian:** The **most significant byte (MSB)** is stored at the **lowest memory address**.  
- **Little-Endian:** The **least significant byte (LSB)** is stored at the **lowest memory address**.

---

### 🧮 Example

Let’s store a 32-bit hexadecimal number: `0x12345678`

#### In Big-Endian:
| Byte | Value | Memory Address |
|------|--------|----------------|
| MSB  | 12     | 1000 |
|      | 34     | 1001 |
|      | 56     | 1002 |
| LSB  | 78     | 1003 |

#### In Little-Endian:
| Byte | Value | Memory Address |
|------|--------|----------------|
| LSB  | 78     | 1000 |
|      | 56     | 1001 |
|      | 34     | 1002 |
| MSB  | 12     | 1003 |

---

### 🖼️ Visualization

```mermaid
graph LR
  subgraph Big-Endian
  A1[1000: 12] --> A2[1001: 34] --> A3[1002: 56] --> A4[1003: 78]
  end
  subgraph Little-Endian
  B1[1000: 78] --> B2[1001: 56] --> B3[1002: 34] --> B4[1003: 12]
  end
```

---

### 💻 C Example to Detect Endianness
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    unsigned int x = 0x12345678;
    unsigned char *ptr = (unsigned char*)&x;
    if (*ptr == 0x78)
        printf("This system is Little Endian\n");
    else
        printf("This system is Big Endian\n");
    return 0;
}
```

---

### 🧠 Key Differences
| Feature | Big-Endian | Little-Endian |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Lowest address holds | MSB | LSB |
| Used by | Motorola, IBM, SPARC | Intel x86, AMD |
| Human readability | Matches number representation | Reverse order |
| Network byte order | Default | Needs conversion |

---

### 💡 Analogy
Think of a 4-digit number **1234**:
- Big-Endian → Written as **1234** (MSB first)
- Little-Endian → Written as **4321** (LSB first)

## 🖥️ 2. Computer Peripherals

### 🧠 Definition
**Peripherals** are external or auxiliary devices that provide **input, output, storage, or communication** capabilities.  
They are connected via I/O interfaces and enhance the computer’s usability.

---

### 🔸 Classification of Peripherals
| Type | Function | Examples |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Input Devices | Feed data to computer | Keyboard, Mouse, Scanner |
| Output Devices | Display or output data | Monitor, Printer, Speaker |
| Storage Devices | Store data permanently | HDD, SSD, USB |
| Communication Devices | Data transfer | Modem, Router, NIC |

---

  O -->|Monitor, Printer| CPU
  S -->|HDD, SSD| CPU
  N -->|Router, NIC| CPU
```

### 🔹 Functions
#### 🧮 Input Devices
- Keyboard: Generates scan codes for keypresses  
- Mouse: Converts motion into cursor movement  
- Scanner: Converts images into digital format  

#### 🖨️ Output Devices
- Monitor: Displays visual information  
- Printer: Produces hard copies  
- Speaker: Generates sound output  

#### 💾 Storage Devices
- Primary: RAM, Cache  
- Secondary: Hard Drives, SSD  
- Tertiary: Optical Discs, Tape Drives  

#### 🌐 Communication Devices
- Modem: Modulates/demodulates signals  
- NIC: Network Interface Card for data exchange  
- Router: Connects and routes between networks

### ⚙️ I/O Communication Techniques
| Method | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Programmed I/O | CPU polls device until ready | Simple microcontrollers |
| Interrupt-driven I/O | Device signals CPU when ready | Keyboard, Mouse |
| DMA | Device transfers data directly to memory | Disk, GPU |

---

### 💡 Peripheral Interface Concepts
- **Port:** Physical or logical connection point (USB, HDMI, etc.)  
- **Device Driver:** Software that enables OS-device communication  
- **Controller:** Hardware managing communication between device & CPU  

---

### 🧠 Example: Keyboard Input Flow
1. Key pressed → Encoder generates scan code  
2. Signal sent to I/O controller  
3. Controller triggers interrupt  
4. CPU reads data from buffer  
5. OS interprets and displays character

## 🧮 3. Von Neumann SISD Organization

### 🧠 Background
Proposed by **John von Neumann in 1945**, this architecture forms the basis of most modern computing systems.

---

### 🔹 Key Concept
A **single memory** holds **both instructions and data**.  
Processing occurs **sequentially** — one instruction operates on one data element at a time.

---

### 🔸 Main Characteristics
| Feature | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Memory | Common for program and data |
| ALU | Performs arithmetic/logic operations |
| Control Unit | Fetches, decodes, and executes instructions |
| I/O | Interfaces for input and output |
| Flynn’s Category | SISD (Single Instruction, Single Data) |

---

  MEM --> ALU[Arithmetic Logic Unit]
  ALU --> OUT[Output Devices]

```

---

### 🔹 Component Descriptions
| Component | Function |
|------------|-----------|
| Memory | Stores data and program instructions |
| Control Unit | Fetches and decodes instructions |
| ALU | Executes arithmetic and logic operations |
| Registers | Temporary storage during execution |
| I/O Interface | Handles external device communication |

---

### 🔹 Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle
$$
\text{Instruction Cycle} = \text{Fetch} \rightarrow \text{Decode} \rightarrow \text{Execute}
$$

#### Steps:
1. **Fetch:** Get instruction from memory.  
2. **Decode:** Interpret operation and operands.  
3. **Execute:** Perform the operation and store the result.

### 🔹 SISD Explanation
| Aspect | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| Instruction Stream | Single instruction executed at a time |
| Data Stream | Operates on one data item |
| Example | Intel 8086, early microprocessors |

---

### 🧮 Example Assembly Code
```assembly
LOAD R1, A
LOAD R2, B
ADD R3, R1, R2
STORE R3, C
```
Each instruction executed sequentially by a single processor.

---

### ⚠️ Von Neumann Bottleneck
- **Issue:** Data and instructions share a single memory and bus.  
- **Result:** CPU stalls waiting for memory access.  
- **Impact:** Limits instruction throughput and system performance.

---

### 🔹 Flynn’s Taxonomy Comparison
| Category | Instruction Stream | Data Stream | Example |
|-----------|--------------------|-------------|----------|
| SISD | Single | Single | Intel 8086 |
| SIMD | Single | Multiple | GPUs |
| MISD | Multiple | Single | Pipeline processors |
| MIMD | Multiple | Multiple | Multicore CPUs, clusters |
